**Contents:**

1. [Lab 1](1%20-%20Statistics.c): Find mean, median, mode and standard deviation of a given dataset using an array.
2. [Lab 2](2%20-%20Greatest.c): Find the highest number in a given matrix.
3. [Lab 3](3%20-%20Second%20Greatest.c): Find the second largest element in an array.
4. [Lab 4](4%20-%20Array%20Reversal.c): Reverse an array without using extra space
5. [Lab 5](5%20-%20Sine%20Wave.c): Display sine wave of given amplitude and no. of asterisks per 180 degree phase.
6. [Lab 6](6%20-%20Two%20Stacks.c): Implement two stack using 1-D array where the total size of both stacks are fixed but individual size may differ (use Dynamic Memory allocation and structure concepts)
7. [Lab 7](7%20-%20Infix%20To%20Postfix.c): Use stack operations to convert given infix expression into its postfix equivalent. Implement the stack using an array.
8. [Lab 8](8%20-%20Linked%20List%20Operations.c): Use functions to perform the following operations:  
    (a) Create a singly linked list of integers.  
    (b) Delete a given integer from the above list.  
    (c) Display the contents of the above list after deletion
9. [Lab 9.1](9.1%20-%20Deque%20Using%20Array.c): Implement double ended queue ADT using (a) Array.  
   [Lab 9.2](9.2%20-%20Deque%20Using%20Linked%20List.c): Implement double ended queue ADT using (b) Doubly Linked List.
10. [Lab 10](10%20-%20Binary%20Search%20Tree.c): Use functions to perform the following operations:  
    (a) Create a binary search tree of characters  
    (b) Traverse the binary tree recursively in postorder, preorder and inorder.
11. [Lab 11](11%20-%20Priority%20Queue.c): Implement Priority Queue using BInary Heap.
12. [Lab 12](12%20-%20Symmetry.c): Check whether two trees are symmetric or not and also find that given tree is BST or not.
13. [Lab 13](13%20-%20Hashing.c): Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing.
14. [Lab 14.1](14.1%20-%20Depth%20First%20Search.c): Implement (i) Depth First Search.  
    [Lab 14.2](14.2%20-%20Breadth%20First%20Search.c): Implement (ii) Breadth First Search.  
    [Lab 14.3](14.3%20-%20Topological%20Sort.c): Implement(iii) Topological Sort on DAG using DFS.
